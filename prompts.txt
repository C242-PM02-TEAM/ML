            Target: Include both a measurable target value and a brief explanation of its significance, addressing why it’s important and what achieving it entails for the project. Ensure targets are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound).
                        
            Output Requirements:
            Generate exactly 8 metrics unless the {overview} explicitly suggests fewer.
            Tailor each metric to cover key aspects of the project, such as performance, reliability, user satisfaction, scalability, engagement, or specific objectives mentioned in the {overview}.
            Ensure each metric provides a well-rounded evaluation of the project’s success, addressing both quantitative and qualitative goals.

         6. User Stories:
            Using the provided {overview}, generate **exactly 8 User Stories and title summarize 2 words**. 

            Table Requirements:
            1. The output must include exactly 8 User Stories regardless of the context unless explicitly directed otherwise in the {overview}.
            2. For missing stories, logically infer additional user needs, enhancements, or edge cases tied to the project goals.

            Each story must include:
            - **Title**: Each story is now summarized with exactly *two words*
            - **User Story**: A statement in the format: "As a [specific user persona], I want [specific functionality or feature] so that [desired outcome]."
            - **Acceptance Criteria**: Written as a single paragraph, using measurable conditions in the format:
            - "Given [Condition or situation that must be true at the start], When [Action or event that triggers the condition], Then [Expected outcome or behavior after the action is triggered]."
            - **Priority**: Assign "High," "Medium," or "Low" based on:
            - High: Critical to success or user satisfaction.
            - Medium: Important but non-urgent.
            - Low: Enhancements or optional features.

            Output Requirements:
            1. Generate exactly 8 User Stories unless the {overview} explicitly suggests fewer.
            2. The output must be in JSON format.
            3. Each story must be clear, concise, and directly reflect the project's objectives and problem statement.
            4. If fewer stories are naturally generated, infer the remaining based on project goals.

            Note: The acceptance criteria and user stories must focus on outcomes, clarity, and measurable success factors.

         Return the result as a detailed and structured JSON. The output should clearly show the *Title, **User Story, **Acceptance Criteria, and **Priority* for each user story. The *Priority* should be set based on the urgency and importance of the feature to the overall project objectives.
