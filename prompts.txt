        - Created Date: {created_date}

       Overview:
        Project Dates: Start Date: {start_date}, End Date: {end_date}

        The PRD should include the following sections:
        Input Overview: {overview}

        1. *Problem Statement*: Based on the provided {overview}, develop a detailed and cohesive statement in **two paragraphs**. Each paragraph should contain no fewer than five sentences. In the first paragraph, clearly articulate the core issue the project aims to solve, including its root causes. Explain why this issue is significant within the relevant context, whether it's related to industry trends, user needs, or operational challenges. Discuss how current solutions fail to address this issue adequately, highlighting any inefficiencies or gaps. In the second paragraph, elaborate on the broader impact of this problem, including how it affects stakeholders, industries, or users at large. Discuss the potential risks of not addressing this issue and how the status quo could worsen over time. The problem statement should emphasize the urgency of solving this issue and why the project is crucial.
        
        2. *Objective*: Based on the provided {overview},Provide a clear and actionable objective section in **two paragraphs**. In the first paragraph, define the primary goals of the project and how they specifically address the identified problem. Clearly outline the desired outcomes or deliverables, ensuring they are aligned with the problem statement. Discuss how these goals will improve existing processes, reduce inefficiencies, or meet user demands. In the second paragraph, outline measurable and actionable results expected from the project. Highlight how the project will achieve these results using innovative methods, technologies, or process improvements. Make sure the objectives are realistic, time-bound, and linked to tangible benefits for stakeholders and users.
         

        3. *DARCI Table*:
           - *Decider*: The person who has the final authority on key decisions, such as whether a feature gets prioritized, approving additional costs or resources, or making decisions that might affect the public relations (PR) of the project.
           - *Accountable*: The person responsible for overseeing the entire project, ensuring tasks are completed on time and within scope, and reporting to decision-makers. This person is fully accountable for the success or failure of the project.
           - *Responsible*: The individuals or teams actively involved in executing specific tasks related to the project. They handle the technical aspects and implementation of the solution.
           - *Consulted*: The stakeholders or experts whose input is necessary for the success of the project. Their feedback and advice are valuable, but they are not responsible for completing tasks.
           - *Informed*: Those who need to be kept updated about the project’s progress, challenges, and results. They don’t actively contribute but are kept in the loop.

           Please generate *tags* and *guidelines* for each role that explain their responsibilities and involvement in the project.

        4. *Project Timeline*:
           - Generate a *Project Timeline* table with the following columns:
             -*Time Period*: Generate specific time periods from the start and end dates provided. Ensure the timeline spans the given period and break it down into clear, actionable segments.
             -*Activity*: List the major activities or tasks to be completed during each time period. Ensure the activities are relevant to the project's scope, such as research, development, testing, deployment, etc.
             -*PIC (Person in Charge)*: Assign specific team members or teams to each activity. If the exact individuals are not available, use placeholder names like 'Team Engineering' or 'Project Manager' for responsibilities.
                Be sure to break down the overall timeline into smaller, manageable tasks. The output should follow a structure like this:
                - Ensure the timeline includes multiple phases of the project, each with clearly defined activities and responsible persons.
                - Provide *Time Period* and *Activity* for each phase and ensure to assign a *PIC* for each task. The timeline should be broken down into milestones and key activities, such as design, development, integration, testing, and deployment.
                  The PRD should include the following *Project Timeline* section:

                - Time Period: [Start Date] - [End Date]
                - Activity: [Describe the activity that will take place during this period]
                - PIC: [Name of person/team responsible for the activity]

                Example:
                1. Time Period: 03 Sep 2024 - 20 Sep 2024
                Activity: Model Development (e.g., MTCNN/DeepFace)
                PIC: Team Engineering

                2. Time Period: 23 Sep 2024 - 07 Oct 2024
                Activity: Flask/FastAPI Development
                PIC: Team Engineering

                3. Time Period: 07 Oct 2024 - 18 Oct 2024
                Activity: Mobile Integration (e.g., Kotlin)
                PIC: Team Engineering

                4. Time Period: 21 Oct 2024 - 01 Nov 2024
                Activity: Testing and Optimization
                PIC: Team Engineering

                The timeline should be as detailed as possible, breaking down large tasks into smaller subtasks if necessary, and assign realistic timeframes and responsibilities.

        5. *Success Metrics*:
           - Define a *Success Metrics* table with the following columns:
             - *Metrics*: The specific measure of success, such as accuracy, performance, user satisfaction, etc.
             - *Definition*: A clear description of what the metric represents.
             - *Actual*: The current or estimated actual value of the metric (can be left as "N/A" initially).
             - *Target: The target value that needs to be achieved for this metric. The **Target* does not have to be a percentage; it can be a specific value, such as a time frame, number of users, or performance level.
           - Provide clear *Target* values based on the *Metrics* and *Definition*. Make sure the metrics align with the project's key objectives.

        6. *User Stories*:
           - *Title*: Provide a descriptive title for the user story (e.g., "Dataset Access" or "User Registration" or "Train Model" or "SDK Integrating" or "API For ClassifyingImages" or "More relevantresponses" or "Greeting"or "Consultation" or "Services" or "Contact" or "Dataset Access" or "UserRegistration" or "User Login"  or "Search EcoFriendly Accommodations" or "Book Sustainable Transportation -e-Car" or "User Prole Management" or "Transport Destination" or "PaymentMethod" or "Maturity Detection Accuracy Enhancement" or "Capture On-Field Seamlessly with ESP32 Cam" or "Centralized Data Management with Reliable Cloud Connectivity ").
           - *User Story*: A brief description of the user need (e.g., "As a user, I want to access a comprehensive dataset of images for training purposes", or "As a user, I
